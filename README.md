## &#x20;The reality of Korea

South Korean society currently imposes harsh realities on men in their 20s and 30s. These men must navigate fierce competition and are also obligated to fulfill mandatory military service, a duty imposed exclusively on men. Despite shouldering these responsibilities, social benefits are predominantly allocated to women or those in their 50s and older. This exacerbates the inequality and unfairness experienced by young men.

Furthermore, feminism has deviated significantly from its original intent and has morphed into a form of misandry, ridiculing men in their 20s and 30s. In South Korea, this male-bashing under the guise of feminism is widespread among women under 40. They engage in organized and extreme activities, leading many young men to give up on their dreams of marriage and family. Additionally, observing the treatment of married men in older generations causes many young men to become skeptical about the prospect of a healthy married life.

The structural and policy issues within society also complicate the lives of men in their 20s and 30s. South Korea's cost of living is among the highest in the world, presenting a significant barrier for the younger generation to achieve financial independence. Various unreasonable regulations and policies further exacerbate these issues. As economic instability and living costs rise, young men are increasingly forced to delay or abandon marriage and childbirth for financial reasons.

These difficulties are reflected in South Korea's ultralow birthrate. The unprecedented birthrate of 0.7 starkly illustrates the structural problems and policy failures of South Korean society. This signifies a bleak future for the country. Population decline and aging will lead to increased social welfare costs, infrastructure collapse, and pension depletion, imposing significant burdens on future generations.

Despite these challenges, South Korean society continues to shift all responsibility and blame onto men in their 20s and 30s who have just completed their military service and are entering society. By blaming young men for societal problems and structural imbalances and placing excessive responsibility on them, their mental and emotional stress is further aggravated.

In such a reality, many men in their 20s and 30s consider leaving South Korea. The desire to emigrate in search of a better quality of life is increasing, leading to the potential exodus of smart and capable young talents from South Korea. This will weaken the nation's competitiveness and likely evolve into a severe social issue. Furthermore, men in their 20s and 30s are adopting a form of resistance known as 'Tang ping.' Tang ping involves doing only the minimum necessary for survival and rejecting everything else, representing an idealistic and sophisticated form of resistance against existing inequalities. This resistance can be seen as a silent rebellion against societal pressure and unfairness, and a form of psychological departure from South Korea.



### &#x20;Therefore, in this document, the following activities are planned:

1. Introduction and documentation of various issues in South Korea.
2. Translation of various issues in South Korea.
